Clothing (also known as clothes and attire) is fibre and textile material worn on the body. The wearing of clothing is mostly restricted to human beings and is a feature of nearly all human societies.
The amount and type of clothing worn depends on body type, social, and geographic considerations. Some clothing can be gender-specific.
